## What Is Branch Protection?

Branch protection is a repository setting that enforces certain rules when trying to merge to a protected branch. See
the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)
for more details.

## What Do We Use It For?

We use it to enforce that mandatory jobs succeed before allowing a merge. These jobs are marked as `Required` in their GitHub
status context. Sample:
![Required Status context](/branchprotection_sample_required_job.png)


If you open a new Pull Request to a branch that has required jobs, these jobs will initially be marked as
`Required - Context Expected`. Sample:
![Required absent Status context](/branchprotection_sample_required_job_status_expected.png)

This status is generated by GitHub and means that Prow didn't report the job as running yet.

Additionally, the branch protection settings are interpreted by the merge automation
[`tide`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/cmd/tide/README.md) in order to [determine if jobs that
are not managed by Prow should be considered merge
blocking.](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/jobs.md#requiring-jobs-for-auto-merge-through-tide)

## How Do We Set up Branch Protection?

Branch Protection requires no manual set-up for repositories with presubmit jobs. When a mandatory presubmit job is
added or removed from a repository, automation will ensure that the GitHub Branch Protection settings are updated as
well.

Branch protection is configured by a job that runs periodically every six hours. You can see
[here](https://prow.ci.openshift.org/?job=periodic-branch-protector) when it last ran. The implication of this is that
when you add/remove a mandatory job, it may take up to six hours for this change to show up in GitHub.

The `openshift-merge-robot` that configures the branch protection needs admin permissions.

## Is It Possible to Disable the Branch Protection for My Repository or Require Jobs That Are Not Managed by Prow?

Yes, these settings are configured [in the Prow
config.](https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/core-services/prow/02_config/_config.yaml)

The basic structure looks like this:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
branch-protection:
  orgs:
    << org >>:
      repos:
        << repo >>:
          # Protect all branches
          protect: true
          # This external check must pass before merging is allowed
          required_status_checks:
            contexts:
            - my-other-ci-system
          branches:
            << branch >>:
              # Do not protect this branch. This setting can be set
              # for the org, repo or branch. Set it at the highest level
              # that makes sense. Lower levels can override it.
              unmanaged: true
{{< / highlight >}}

An overview of all available settings and a more detailled explanation can be found in the
[upstream documentation.](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/cmd/branchprotector/README.md)

### Notes on `protect: false`

Unfortunately, setting up `protect: false` may have unexpected effects because of how it interacts
with Prow jobs required for merges. OpenShift CI is by default configured to enforce branch protection
for all branches that have at least one required Prow job. If `protect: false` is
configured for such a branch, `branchprotector` will not manage its branch protection settings.
However, if there **is not** a required Prow job on a branch, `protect: false` causes `branchprotector`
to ensure the branch protection is disabled on the branch (and therefore, the `openshift-merge-robot`
account needs the admin permissions that are necessary for this operation).

If your goal is to not have Prow manage the branch proection, please use `unmanaged: true` instead of
`protect: false`.

| Required jobs | `protect:` stanza  | What `branchprotector` does  | Requires admin |
|---|---|---|---|
| yes | absent | Enforces BP for required jobs | yes |
| yes | `true` | Enforces BP for required jobs | yes |
| yes | `false` | Does not touch BP settings | no |
| no | absent | Does not touch BP settings | no |
| no | `true` | Enforces BP defined by the configuration | yes |
| no | `false` | Enforces BP is disabled | yes |
