description: An overview of payload testing.

TRT needs the capability to run [a selected subset of release qualification jobs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-hGyTnWFUuN5UMGdUnL9yK27kIUX31AfOigJrWrc2o/edit?usp=sharing) on selected pull requests in all repositories that contribute to OCP, before they are merged.
The `PullRequestPayloadQualificationRun` CRD and the `/payload` command is provided for this purpose.


## Usage

### Payload Command
Any collaborator of the GitHub OpenShift organization can issue the command on a pull request to a branch of a repository of the organization that contributes to OpenShift official images:

> /payload <ocp_version> <ci|nightly> <informing|blocking>

For example, if `/payload 4.10 nightly informing` is issued on a PR, the robot will reply the list of the triggered jobs:

![payload command](/payload-cmd.png)

The jobs triggered by the command are determined by [OpenShift Release Controllers](/docs/getting-started/useful-links/#services).
The linked page from [payload-tests portal](https://pr-payload-tests.ci.openshift.org/runs/) at the bottom of the comment shows the status of the payload testing and the details of those jobs.

The images from multiple PRs from distinct repositories can also be included in the payload tested by using the `/payload-with-prs` command, such as
> /payload-with-prs <ocp_version> <ci|nightly> <informing|blocking> <org/repo#number> [<org/repo#number ...]

A particular job or set of jobs can be triggered by `/payload-job`, such as

> /payload-job <periodic_ci_openshift_release_some_job> <periodic_ci_openshift_release_another_job>

The payload tested can also include the images from multiple PRs from distinct repositories by using `/payload-job-with-prs`, such as

> /payload-job-with-prs <periodic_ci_openshift_release_some_job> <org/repo#number> [<org/repo#number ...]

A job can be executed more than once by a single `/payload-aggregate` command, e.g, 

> /payload-aggregate <periodic_ci_openshift_release_some_job> <aggregated_count>

It is also possible to use the aggregation logic with additional PRs included in the payload with the `/payload-aggregate-with-prs` command, e.g, 

> /payload-aggregate-with-prs <periodic_ci_openshift_release_some_job> <aggregated_count> <org/repo#number> [<org/repo#number ...]

{{% alert title="NOTE" color="warning" %}}
`/payload-with-prs`, `/payload-aggregate`, `/payload-aggregate-with-prs`, and `/payload-job-with-prs` only accept a single command per comment; additional commands need to be triggered with separate comments (not just separate lines).
{{% /alert %}}

#### Abort all Payload Jobs
It is possible to quickly abort all running payload jobs for a specific PR. Simply comment `/payload-abort` on the PR to do so.

### Manually Submitting a `PRPQR`
It is also possible to manually create a `PullRequestPayloadQualificationRun` instance without using the `payload` command.
This allows for additional options to be supplied that are currently not possible via the command.
The following is an example of a full `PRPQR` CR that can be applied to the `app.ci` cluster to trigger a payload job:

```yaml
apiVersion: ci.openshift.io/v1
kind: PullRequestPayloadQualificationRun
metadata:
  name: manually-submitted-prpqr
  namespace: ci
spec:
  initial: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:4.13.0-0.nightly-2024-02-01-213342
  payload:
    base: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:4.13.0-0.nightly-2024-02-06-120750
  jobs:
    releaseControllerConfig:
      ocp: ''
      release: ''
      specifier: ''
    releaseJobSpec:
    - ciOperatorConfig:
        branch: master
        org: openshift
        repo: release
        variant: ci-4.15
      test: e2e-aws-sdn-upgrade
  pullRequests:
  - baseRef: master
    baseSHA: 270de19d62fc7275f22de22a7eca270bd77dd05d
    org: openshift
    pr:
      author: developer
      number: 1575
      sha: c9817bfb09b48bc84ef20a1cf5a01cac36c2687d
      title: 'A Pull Request'
    repo: kubernetes
```

#### Supplying Multiple PRs from Component Repositories
The `ci-operator` can assemble a release payload by building and using images from multiple PRs in distinct OCP component repos.
In order to do this, refs for each PR must be provided in the `PRPQR` spec:

```yaml
...
spec:
  jobs:
    ...
  pullRequests:
    - baseRef: master
      baseSHA: 270de19d62fc7275f22de22a7eca270bd77dd05d
      org: openshift
      pr:
        author: developer
        number: 1575
        sha: c9817bfb09b48bc84ef20a1cf5a01cac36c2687d
        title: 'A Pull Request'
      repo: kubernetes
    - baseRef: master
      baseSHA: dcf812295b06c9463cb7c8d8126a337334049234
      org: openshift
      pr:
        author: developer
        number: 7640
        sha: 7d5da4ce183886b6de33172e7af2a01ca2e46708
        title: 'Another Pull Request'
      repo: installer
...
```

{{% alert title="NOTE" color="warning" %}}
It is currently not possible to assemble the payload from multiple PRs in the same repository. This feature will be available at a later date.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Overriding the Default Payload PullSpecs
It is possible to override the pull-spec used for both the `initial` and `latest` release payloads by manually submitting a `PRPQR`.
This is done by supplying the `spec.initial` and `spec.payload.base` fields respectively:
```yaml
...
spec:
  # useful for supplying a different pull-spec for the initial payload during 'upgrade' jobs
  initial: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:4.13.0-0.nightly-2024-02-01-213342 
  payload:
    # images built using PR code will be layered on top of the base
    base: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:4.13.0-0.nightly-2024-02-06-120750
...
```
