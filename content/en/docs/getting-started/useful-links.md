# Clusters
The clusters that currently comprise CI are:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<ul id="ul_clusters">
</ul>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Except the ones not managed by DPTP, Red Hat SSO is enabled to login onto these clusters.
GitHub Users in OpenShift organization who have no Red Hat SSO can still use Prow services to do CI tasks but they cannot login into these clusters.
